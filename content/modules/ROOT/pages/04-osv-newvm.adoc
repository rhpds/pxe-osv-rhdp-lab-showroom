== Scenario - Persistent Storage Volume Provisioning and Availability for Virtual Machines

In this scenario, we will learn about how to provision a virtual machine on OpenShift Virtualization with Purestorage.

[discrete]
==== Reminder: Accessing the Red Hat OpenShift Console

To connect to the console, click on the `OpenShift Console` tab above.

____
IMPORTANT:
 The `OpenShift Console` tab will open in a new browser window.
____

We can then log in with the following credentials:

Username: `kubeadmin` Password: `{kubeadmin_password}`

== Step 1 - Deploy a Virtual Machine

Start by logging in to the OpenShift console with the information above.

==== Task 1: Create a new VM

Navigate to the virtualzation > overview menu

Click the `Create Virtual Machine` button

Select the Centos Stream image.
We can also use the default instance type.

Verify that our StorageClass is set to `px-csi-db` and click `Create VirtualMachine`

This will automatically start the virtual machine after a short provisioning process.

____
IMPORTANT:
 It can take a couple of minutes for our VM to boot the first time
____

Explore the tabs for this virtual machine.
We can view metrics, configure snapshots, and even view the YAML configuration to make automating easy.

____
IMPORTANT:
 The Virtual Machine name will be different in your environment
____

== Step 2 - Test Live Migrations

In order for live migrations to be supported, OpenShift VirtualMachines need to use a PVC with a ReadWriteMany access mode.
We can verify this by running:

[,bash,subs="attributes",role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc
----

[discrete]
==== Task 1: Live Migrate a VM

Back in the OpenShift Console, click on the `Overview` tab and take note of the node that our VM is running on.

image::livemigrate-vm-01.png[get ocp node]

We can now migrate the VM to a new node by selecting the `Actions` menu, and then clicking `Migrate`

image::livemigrate-vm-02.png[migrate vm]

After a few moments the interface will update with the new node.

It is important to understand that in OpenShift Virtualization, VirtualMachines run inside pods.
This migration spawned a new pod, on the destination node, and then live migrated the VM to that pod.

We can view the running pods by executing:

[,bash,subs="attributes",role="execute"]
----
oc get pods
----

Notice that one of our pods is in the `Completed` state, this is because our virtual machine process is no longer in that pod!

We can view the running VMs by typing:

[,bash,subs="attributes",role="execute"]
----
oc get vms
----

Click `Check` to move on to the next challenge
